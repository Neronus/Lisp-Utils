;;;; HISTORY
;;;; created: july 4, 2006
;;;; v2:      august 20, 2006
;;;;          #[ ]# syntax for template strings; eval expressions cand
;;;;          be added with ?expr
;;;;          read-preserving-whitespace now used in '?', cleaner results
;;;;          wrappers for: tex gs ls pwd mktemp dirname basename md5sum
;;;;          recursive version of md5sum that also works for directories
;;;; v2.1:    august 14, 2007
;;;;          sbcl compatibility
;;;;
;;;;          Made lines-to-list significantly faster (use loop instead of recursion
;;;;          Let mixed-script use mixed-template
;;;;          Converted several calls of the form (script (format ...))
;;;;            to the reader macro form
;;;;          Removed several occurences of the dangling paranthesis
;;;;          Created a special variable *shell* that gets executed in the
;;;;            script command
